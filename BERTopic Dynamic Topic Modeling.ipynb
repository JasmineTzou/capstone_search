stamp the events. \" such bacteria, swallowed by a patient, might be able to record the changes they experience through the whole digestive tract, yielding an unprecedented view of previously inaccessible phenomena, \" said senior author harris wang. other applications could include environmental sensing and basic studies in ecology and microbiology, where bacteria could monitor otherwise invisible changes without disrupting their surroundings. wang and members of his laboratory created the microscopic data recorder by taking advantage of crispr - cas, an immune system in many species of bacteria. crispr - cas copies snippets of dna from invading viruses so that subsequent generations of bacteria can repel these pathogens more effectively. as a result, the crispr locus of the bacterial genome accumulates a chronological record of the bacterial viruses that it and its ancestors have survived. when those same viruses try to infect again, the crispr - cas system can recognize and eliminate them. to build their microscopic recorder, ravi sheth and other members of the wang lab modified a piece of dna called a plasmid, giving it the ability to create more copies of itself in the bacterial cell in response to an external signal. a separate recording plasmid, which drives the recorder and marks time, expresses components of the crispr - cas system. in the absence of an external signal, only the recording plasmid is active, and the cell adds copies of a spacer sequence to the crispr locus in its genome. when an external signal is detected by the cell, the other plasmid is also activated, leading to insertion of its sequences instead. the result is a mixture of background sequences that record time and signal sequences that change depending on the cell's environment. the researchers can then examine the bacterial crispr locus and use computational tools to read the recording and its timing. the current paper proves the system can handle at least three simultaneous signals and record for days. \" now we're planning to [SEP]\n","prediction: worker\n","[CLS] the cuban diplomats expelled from the united states this week included all those dealing with us businesses, cuba's embassy in washington told reporters on thursday, dealing another blow to bilateral commercial ties. in an escalating crisis between the cold war foes, the trump administration on tuesday expelled 15 diplomats to protest communist -

sex marriage under the special marriage act and the foreign marriage act. a division bench of justice rajiv sahai endlaw and justice asha menon asked the centre and others to file their response on the pleas and listed it for further hearing on january 8, 2021. meanwhile, counsel raj kumar yadav, who was representing the centre, told the delhi high court that this is a peculiar situation and such a situation has not occurred in the history of the santana dharma. however, the bench reminded him to interpret the law in favour of the rights of the citizens of the'sanatan dharma'country and said that the law is gender - neutral and do not see this petition as adversarial. advocate kirtiman singh, appearing for a respondent, said that this is not adversarial and shall not be considered that ways and it is a question of our development from where we stand today. singh said that the respondents will file reply on the petitions. appearing for the petitioner, advocate maneka guruswamy said that legal recognition of the two same - sex couples was not allowed under the special marriage act and the foreign marriage act. justice endlaw sought to know from the petitioners'counsels whether the definition of marriage has been challenged and what would marriage be defined by customary laws. the petitioner counsel responded that the special marriage act and the foreign marriage act is not based on customary law and it is statutory in law. the bench said that according to the bench's understanding, marriage till now has not been statutory and as per his knowledge, under the indian law, marriage remains customary. it said that if any corrective measures are to be taken, it should be taken at this stage. have you considered it from that point of view, the bench asked the petitioners. advocate guruswamy told the court that she is challenging the constitutionality of the reading of this statute of the special marriage act and added that the law prohibits who \" cannot enter into a marriage \". a same - sex couple, an indian citizen and an overseas citizen of india, had also approached the court seeking legal recognition of their marriage under the foreign marriage act, 1969, claiming they got married in washington dc, the united states in 2017 but the indian consulate in new york refused to register their marriage. meanwhile, another same - sex couple had last week moved the delhi high court seeking directions to allow the special marriage act [SEP]\n","prediction: coronaviru\n","[CLS] scientists are developing large structures inspired by'cloaking'materials for sound and light, which may be used to protect buildings from earthquakes. earthquakes travel in waves, much as sound and light do. scientists have previously designed materials with internal structures that interfere with the propagation of sound and light. now, researchers at imperial college london in the uk, with collaborators in france, are working on making bigger versions of these structures, which could be used to control the propagation of earthquakes. trees act as resonators, which oscillate at certain frequencies, even at long wavelengths. in the right arrangement, the interaction of resonating trees can redirect the energy of seismic waves deep into the soil, reducing damage. this approach is based on metamaterials, artificial arrangements of resonators with unusual electromagnetic properties, researchers said. metamaterial'invisibility cloaks'have already been used to make very small objects invisible to the eye by redirecting light waves. now, large - scale versions could be created to emulate the resonance of trees and make buildings'invisible'to earthquakes. \" wouldn't it be great if we could surround a historic castle or a nuclear power station with a metamaterial, so that when the seismic waves come at it they are sent around or diverted into the ground, \" said professor richard craster, head of the department of mathematics at imperial. \" the building would remain perfectly still, not damaged. this is what we want to do, \" said craster. earlier this year, dr andrea colombi, also from imperial, with craster and colleagues, demonstrated that a dense forest behaves as a natural seismic metamaterial. by generating vibrations from a crane and measuring the effects with seismometers, they found that the resonating trees offer local protection against surface waves of certain frequencies. in a natural forest, researchers noted that the irregular height of trees and of the gaps between them offered protection against a larger range of frequencies than a uniform array would. if the trees are arranged by decreasing height, they would cover an even wider range of seismic frequencies. scientists call this a'metawedge ', which could eventually be created with real trees or poles acting as artificial resonators. metawedges can only deal effectively with waves coming from two directions, but the researchers are hopeful they can find solutions to this. there are also other potential applications for metawedges, for example using them to mask other kinds of vibrational waves that can impact buildings.
